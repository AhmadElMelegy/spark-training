You have two identical scripts, one is written using Scala, while the other is written using Python. Several code snippets has been removed (replaced by `???`)

Implement the missing code snippets in `quiz.scala` (lines 13 and 14) and `quiz.py` (lines 12 and 14).
So that both programs work and print the same output.

# Expected output
## Python
```
> ./quiz.py
total high raises: 5358
```
## Scala
```
> scala quiz.scala
total high raises: 5358
```

# Installation
You will need [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [Java runtime](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html), and [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/download/install.html) to be installed on your machine to run the code.

If you use Linux or OSX chances that you already have Python installed.
